- Self-supervised training methods enable effective re-identification without extensive identity-labeled datasets
- YOLO11-JDE integration achieves real-time performance with competitive accuracy
- Modern evaluation metrics like HOTA provide more comprehensive tracking assessment than traditional metrics

## 1. Problem Definition and Challenges

### 1.1 Core Problem Statement

Soccer player re-identification involves matching player identities across different video frames, camera viewpoints, or time instances. The task encompasses two primary scenarios:

1. **Cross-camera mapping**: Associating players between broadcast and tactical camera feeds
2. **Single-feed re-identification**: Maintaining consistent player IDs when players temporarily leave and re-enter the frame

### 1.2 Key Challenges[1,2,3]

**Visual Challenges:**
- Similar uniforms worn by teammates making individual distinction difficult
- Low image resolution in broadcast videos
- Motion blur from fast player movements
- Varying lighting conditions across different camera angles
- Occlusions from other players, referees, or field structures

**Technical Challenges:**
- Limited training samples per player identity
- Camera movement affecting view angles and image stability
- External interference (advertising banners, clocks, logos obscuring jersey numbers)
- Real-time processing requirements for live applications
- Domain gap between pre-training datasets and soccer-specific data

**Spatial and Temporal Challenges:**
- Complex player pose variations during gameplay
- Dynamic team formations and player clustering
