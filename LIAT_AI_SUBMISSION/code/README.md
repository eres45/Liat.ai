**Assignment**: Liat.ai AI/ML Intern Technical Assessment  
**Date**: June 13, 2025

## üéØ Overview

This repository contains a complete implementation of a soccer player re-identification system for the Liat.ai technical assignment. The system addresses both assignment options:

1. **Cross-Camera Player Mapping**: Map players between broadcast and tactical camera feeds
2. **Single-Feed Re-identification**: Maintain consistent player IDs when players exit and re-enter the frame

```

### Technical Approach

The system employs a multi-modal feature extraction approach combining:

- **Appearance Features**: ResNet50-based deep features for visual similarity
- **Pose Features**: Geometric shape descriptors for body pose matching

- **Temporal Tracking**: Kalman filtering with Hungarian algorithm for optimal assignment

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-capable GPU (recommended for optimal performance)
- 8GB+ RAM

### Installation

1. **Clone/Download the repository**
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd soccer-player-reid
```

2. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. **Download the YOLOv11 model**
```bash
# Download from provided Google Drive link
# Place as: data/best.pt
```

### Quick Demo

Generate demonstration outputs without processing videos:

```bash
# Option 1: Cross-camera mapping demo
python option1_cross_camera.py --demo --output demo_cross_camera.json

# Option 2: Single-feed re-ID demo
python option2_single_feed.py --demo --output demo_single_feed.json --analyze
```

## üìã Usage

### Option 1: Cross-Camera Player Mapping

Map players between broadcast and tactical camera feeds:

```bash
python option1_cross_camera.py \
    --broadcast broadcast.mp4 \
    --tacticam tacticam.mp4 \
    --output cross_camera_results.json \
    --model data/best.pt
```

**Output Structure:**
```json
{
  "video1_tracks": {
    "frame_id": [
      {"player_id": 1, "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2], "confidence": 0.85}
    ]
  },
  "video2_tracks": {
    "frame_id": [
      {"player_id": 1, "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2], "confidence": 0.87}
    ]
  },
  "cross_camera_mapping": {
    "1": 1,  // Broadcast Player 1 ‚Üí Tacticam Player 1
    "2": 3   // Broadcast Player 2 ‚Üí Tacticam Player 3
  },
  "metadata": {...}
}
```

### Option 2: Single-Feed Re-identification

Maintain consistent IDs in a single video feed:

```bash
python option2_single_feed.py \
    --input 15sec_input_729p.mp4 \
    --output single_feed_results.json \
    --output_video tracked_output.mp4 \
    --model data/best.pt \
    --analyze
```

**Output Structure:**
```json
{
  "tracks": {
    "frame_id": [
      {"player_id": 1, "bbox": [x1, y1, x2, y2], "confidence": 0.85, "timestamp": 0.0}
    ]
  },
  "player_statistics": {
    "1": {
      "total_detections": 45,
      "avg_confidence": 0.87,
      "track_duration": 15.0,
      "last_seen": 15.0
    }
  },
  "tracking_quality": {
    "total_unique_players": 3,
    "average_confidence": 0.887,
    "tracking_stability": 0.92
  },
  "metadata": {...}
}
```

## üîß Technical Implementation

### 1. Detection Pipeline

```python
# YOLOv11-based player detection
players = reid_system.detect_players(frame, timestamp)
```

- Uses provided YOLOv11 model for robust player detection
- Filters for person class with confidence > 0.5
- Extracts player crops for feature analysis

### 2. Feature Extraction

```python
# Multi-modal feature extraction
appearance_features = extract_appearance_features(player_crop)  # 512-dim
pose_features = extract_pose_features(player_crop)              # 5-dim  
color_features = extract_color_features(player_crop)            # 100-dim
```

**Appearance Features (512-dim)**:
- ResNet50 backbone with custom head
- L2-normalized embeddings
- Transfer learning from ImageNet

**Pose Features (5-dim)**:
- Centroid coordinates (cx, cy)
- Contour area and perimeter
- Aspect ratio
- Geometric shape descriptors

**Color Features (100-dim)**:
- HSV histogram analysis
- 36 hue + 32 saturation + 32 value bins
- Team/uniform color classification

### 3. Tracking & Re-identification

```python
# Hungarian algorithm for optimal assignment
similarity_matrix = calculate_similarity_matrix(detections, tracks)
assignments = linear_sum_assignment(-similarity_matrix)
```

**Similarity Calculation**:
- Weighted combination: 70% appearance + 30% pose
- Cosine distance for feature vectors
- Threshold-based assignment (> 0.7)

**Track Management**:
- Kalman filtering for motion prediction
- Feature buffer averaging (10 frames)
- Lost track recovery (30 frame timeout)

### 4. Cross-Camera Mapping

```python
# Cross-camera feature matching
cross_mapping = create_cross_camera_mapping(features1, features2)
```

- Independent tracking in each camera
- Feature-based similarity matching across cameras
- Geometric transformation consideration
- Optimal assignment with similarity thresholds

## üìä Performance Considerations
